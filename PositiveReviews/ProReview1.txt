While TikTok may seem filled with innocuous cat videos and dance challenges, Chinese law requires that Chinese companies share information it gathers with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), including users’ private data. “The CCP’s laws require Chinese companies like ByteDance to spy on their behalf. That means any Chinese company must grant the CCP access and manipulation capabilities as a design feature,” explains U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA). [2] [22]

Should Chinese government officials gain access to TikTok user data, intelligence opportunities could be uncovered to recruit a spy, blackmail a target, or otherwise influence American culture to its benefit. The issue is not that the site collects personal data—many online sites do that—but that the country widely perceived as a competitor if not an enemy of the United States can see the information if not also manipulate content for nefarious, political purposes. [23]

Further, the Chinese government could manipulate TikTok’s algorithm or other operations to expose Americans to communist propaganda, which could be used to influence elections, domestic and international policy, and other political processes. [23]

“The US government cannot ignore TikTok as a potential national security threat, even if efforts to crack down on the company alienate a generation of future voters…. Republicans [and] Democrats agreed this is a threat…. We have to deal with it before it’s too late,” implores U.S. Representative Mike Gallagher (R-WI). [24]
